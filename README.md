## Detect, Replace, Refine: Deep Structured Prediction For Pixel Wise Labeling

This repository implements the paper *"Detect, Replace, Refine: Deep Structured Prediction For Pixel Wise Labeling"* that was accepted in CVPR 2017. An extended technical report is uploaded here:

## Download pre-computed disparity results 
We provide pre-computed disparity maps generated by the "Detect + Replace + Refine x2" architecture. The disparity maps are saved as uint16 PNG images following the instructions of [KITTI 2015 dev kit](kitti.is.tue.mpg.de/kitti/devkit_scene_flow.zip).
